There are two ways establishing communication between two containers.

Way 1:

Expose the port of the mongo Db 27017 from the container to the local. So that any service can connect to the local port.
Modify the backend application to use the local host ip (host.docker.internal).

Way 2:
Dont expose any port run the containers in the host network so now without exposing the port you will be able to connect the database.
In Macos and Windows it doesnot work

Way 3:
We can run the container in the same network and one container can connect with other container using the ip or the containerName.
ContainerName is the best way because ip keeps on changing. we need to expose nodeJS port
